## PyBank
* A Python script for analyzing the financial records with a dataset (in budget_data.csv) that is composed of two columns: Date and Profit/Losses. 
* The Python script analyzes the records and calculates the following:
  * The total number of months included in the dataset.
  * The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period.
  * The average of the changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period.
  * The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period.
  * The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period.
* The final script prints the analysis to the terminal and exports the results to a text file called 'pybank.txt'.
* The final results are printed as the following:
